# ColorToLed

Project proposal - 

A user will be able to analyze any image by its URL; returning the 6 most predominant color groups of the image. The user can select which color to have displayed on an LED.
My application provieds a more hands on real world display for visualizing colors.

technologies used - Color value conversion library, colortag API from Mashape.

MVP goals- The user would input one URL linking to an image. The most predominant color would be displayed on an LED.
Strech goals - the image being referenced would display on the page. All six colors would have a thumbnail to display on the page. In addition to the six hex colors displayed on the page, there would be another column of six colors representing the original color value after if has been converted to the rgb compatible value. Adding a button to allow the user to choose which color to upload to the LED.

user stories - as a user I can input an URL linking directly to an image, and I will be shown the six color groupings.
as a user, I can click on one of the six colors and it will be uploaded to the LED.
